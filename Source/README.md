## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Project Configuration**
Ensure your Unreal project includes these modules:
- `ChaosVehicles` (for vehicle physics)
- `NavigationSystem` (for AI navigation)
- `Niagara` (for particle effects)
- `GameplayTasks` (for AI behavior)

### 2. **Input Mapping**
Set up these input mappings in your project settings:

**Character Controls:**
- `MoveX`, `MoveY` (Axis)
- `LookX`, `LookY` (Axis)
- `Jump` (Action)
- `Sprint` (Action)
- `Interact` (Action)
- `ExitVehicle` (Action)

**Vehicle Controls:**
- `Throttle`, `Steer`, `Brake` (Axis)
- `Handbrake` (Action)
- `Horn` (Action)
- `ToggleLights` (Action)
- `LeftTurnSignal`, `RightTurnSignal` (Action)

### 3. **Visual Assets**
For the best experience, you'll need:
- Niagara particle systems for effects
- Audio assets for engine sounds, weather, etc.
- UI widgets for the HUD system
- Vehicle meshes and materials

## 🎨 Customization

### Character Movement
```cpp
// Adjust movement speeds
WalkSpeed = 400.f;
RunSpeed = 600.f;
SprintMultiplier = 1.8f;

// Camera settings
CameraSmoothness = 5.0f;
CameraTiltAmount = 15.0f;
```

### Vehicle Physics
```cpp
// Smoothing settings
AccelerationSmoothness = 3.0f;
SteeringSmoothness = 5.0f;
BrakeSmoothness = 4.0f;

// Camera settings
CameraDistance = 600.0f;
CameraHeight = 200.0f;
```

### Weather System
```cpp
// Time settings
DayLengthSeconds = 600.f; // 10 minutes per day
TimeAcceleration = 1.0f;

// Weather settings
WeatherTransitionDuration = 5.0f;
WeatherChangeInterval = 300.0f; // 5 minutes
```

## 🌟 Performance Tips

1. **Particle Effects**: Use LODs for weather effects based on distance
2. **Audio**: Implement audio pooling for frequent sounds
3. **Lighting**: Use dynamic lighting sparingly, prefer static lighting where possible
4. **Physics**: Limit the number of active vehicles for better performance

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Vehicle Physics Not Working**: Ensure ChaosVehicles plugin is enabled
2. **Weather Effects Missing**: Check Niagara plugin and particle systems
3. **Audio Not Playing**: Verify audio components and sound assets
4. **UI Not Showing**: Ensure UI widget classes are set in the HUD
